# Happy Thoughts

This project was about the lifecycle of components and using useEffect to react to changes in state or a component mounting.

## The problem

I started this project with the codealong to the lectures. This was quite helpful, since it showed quite clearly which components were needed. After having started the project with the components last week I wanted to go the other way this week by starting with building everything in the App.js and then split it up in a next step. To me, starting with the components seem to make more sense, so I'll probably stick to that approach in future projects. 
I didn't have much time for coding this week, so I went for the blue level. If I had more time I'd would have added the count for the input, that shows how many characters the user has already typed. 
I got help from my team and stackoverflow and most of the struggles were already mentioned in the lectures. 
One thing I couldn't make work was getting the updated date from the server right after sending a POST request. Somehow I then had to refresh the browser to get the updated data (comments in App.js). So now I went with my second choice where I send a POST request to the server and at the same time update the local state.
