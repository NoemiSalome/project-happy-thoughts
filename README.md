# Bootcamp-Project #09: Happy Thoughts

This project was about the lifecycle of components and using useEffect to react to changes in state or a component mounting. The concept is in abstract way like Twitter: fetching and posting data to an API (lilkes, posts).

## Learning content and lessons learned:
- What component lifecycle means.
- How to use the useEffect hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes.
- How to call APIs from React and put the data into state
- Following a given design

After having started the project with the components last week I wanted to go the other way this week by starting with building everything in the App.js and then split it up in a next step. This week once more stackoverflow and my teammates did the trick in the end to get the app up and running.

The API for this weeks project was already setup. There are three endpoints for posting a thought, fetching the thoughts and posting likes. Later on in the bootcamp the API and its endpoints werde built in one of the weekly project. This project is now connected to the project #19: Project Happy Thoughts API (https://github.com/NoemiSalome/project-happy-thoughts-api)
